          <Paragraph>
            <Bold>Deep tissue massage </Bold>is designed to apply deep pressure to the underlying
            muscle layers and connective tissues. The goal is to target knots, tight areas, and
            chronic tension that are often embedded deep within the muscles. This technique uses
            slow strokes and firm pressure to break down scar tissue, alleviate tension, and improve
            the overall function of muscles and joints.{" "}
            <Bold>

            is typically used for athletes or individuals who are physically active.{" "}

              It is a more targeted approach that focuses on areas of the body that are prone to
              injury or strain due to repetitive motion or intense physical activity.

            Unlike deep tissue massage, which works deeply into the muscle layers,{" "}

            involves a combination of stretching, manipulation, and soft tissue techniques designed
            to improve flexibility, enhance performance, and accelerate recovery from injuries.
            Sports massage can also be customized based on the phase of activity, whether it is
            pre-event (to warm up muscles) or post-event (to promote muscle recovery).

            option for athletes because it helps heal specific injuries, enhances flexibility, and

          <Paragraph>
            Deep tissue massage involves a significant amount of pressure, often reaching deeper
            muscle layers that lighter massage techniques cannot access. It can be intense,
            especially when dealing with severe muscle knots or tension. Some clients may feel
            discomfort during the massage, but this is usually followed by long-term relief once the
            tension is released.

          <Heading3>Sports massage: targeted and varied</Heading3>
          <Paragraph>
            Sports massage can range from gentle to firm, depending on the treatment goals. While it
            can involve deep pressure, the focus is more on precision and targeted manipulation
            rather than accessing the deeper layers of muscle tissue. Because of this, the intensity
            can vary throughout the session depending on whether the therapist is warming up muscles
            or working on injury rehabilitation.

            Deep Tissue Massage is not recommended for individuals with certain medical conditions
            or those who are highly sensitive to pressure. If you have conditions such as blood
            clots, recent surgery, or inflammation, it is best to avoid this massage style as the
            intense pressure may exacerbate these issues.
