          <Heading2>What is Neck Pain?</Heading2>
          <Paragraph>
            Neck pain refers to discomfort in the cervical region of the spine, which includes the
            vertebrae, muscles, nerves, and connective tissues. It can range from mild stiffness to
            severe, chronic pain that affects daily activities.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            The neck, or cervical spine, is a highly mobile yet vulnerable structure. It supports
            the head, allows for movement, and protects the spinal cord. However, due to its
            flexibility and constant use, it is prone to strain, misalignment, and injury. Neck pain
            may result from poor posture, muscle tension, or underlying conditions such as arthritis
            or disc issues. If left untreated, it can lead to more severe musculoskeletal problems.

              <Bold>Poor Posture:</Bold> Slouching while sitting or looking down at screens for
